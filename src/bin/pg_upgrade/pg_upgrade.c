 *	To simplify the upgrade process, we force certain system values to be

 *
 *	We control all assignments of pg_class.oid (and relfilenode) so toast

 *	because toast oids are stored as toast pointers in user tables.
 *
 *	While pg_class.oid and pg_class.relfilenode are initially the same in a
 *	cluster, they can diverge due to CLUSTER, REINDEX, or VACUUM FULL. We
 *	control assignments of pg_class.relfilenode because we want the filenames
 *	to match between the old and new cluster.
 *
 *	We control assignment of pg_tablespace.oid because we want the oid to match
 *	between the old and new cluster.
 *
 *	We control all assignments of pg_type.oid because these oids are stored
 *	in user composite type values.
 *
 *	We control all assignments of pg_enum.oid because these oids are stored
 *	in user tables as enum values.
 *
 *	We control all assignments of pg_authid.oid because the oids are stored in
 *	pg_largeobject_metadata, which is copied via file transfer for upgrades

		 * window must survive; a restart_lsn past CN could let CN be
		 * recycled.  The pin is size-independent (see server.c's
		 * max_slot_wal_keep_size=-1).
		 *
		 * The consumer, if any, determines whether a slot is needed:
		 *
		 * - The old cluster HAD physical slots (a standby was connected).  We
		 * migrate them here with immediately_reserve = true, which reserves
		 * each slot's restart_lsn at the burst server's CURRENT insert
		 * position.  Correctness of the pin (restart_lsn <= CN) rests
		 * entirely on this loop running BEFORE the CN checkpoint is emitted
		 * just below (binary_upgrade_emit_wal_window); the migrated slots
		 * carry only the slot NAME across, not the old restart_lsn, so the
		 * reserve happens here and now.  Every migrated slot reserves
		 * at/before CN, so the window is pinned at the minimum of their
		 * restart_lsns (all <= CN) -- it does not matter which one; any one
		 * suffices.  Keep the create loop ahead of the emit call: moving it
		 * after CN would silently break retention.  The standby reconnects
		 * with its own real primary_slot_name, and the standby-provisioning
		 * lifecycle drops the slot once caught up.
		 *
		 * - No physical slot, but archiving is configured (archive-PITR).  No
		 * slot is needed: the window's durable home is the archive, not
		 * pg_wal/.  Generation cannot recycle it (the burst server uses
		 * max_wal_size=1TB / checkpoint_timeout=1h so no checkpoint fires
		 * between CN and shutdown), and the wait-for-archive barrier below
		 * guarantees CN..COMPLETE reaches the archive before shutdown; after
		 * that pg_wal/ recycling is harmless because PITR restores from the
		 * archive.
		 *
		 * - No physical slot AND no archiving.  Then --wal-upgrade has no
		 * consumer for the window at all: no standby will stream it (a slot
		 * is the operator's declaration that one is expected) and no PITR
		 * will read it.  The primary keeps its transferred files and
		 * auto-serves exactly as a plain pg_upgrade would, so the window is
		 * simply unused; we do NOT pin it, and it is recycled as ordinary
		 * WAL.  A standby wanted later is built conventionally (fresh base
