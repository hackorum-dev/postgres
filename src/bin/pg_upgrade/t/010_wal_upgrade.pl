# Tests for "pg_upgrade --wal-upgrade" on a single (primary-only) cluster.
#
# --wal-upgrade captures the whole upgrade as WAL so the change is
# revertable, then leaves the new cluster as a normal, fully-upgraded cluster
# that comes up read-write on its first start like any upgraded cluster.  This
# test drives the two primary-only paths and, at
# each step, asserts the cluster's control-file STATE transitions the way the
# state machine says it should and ends in the expected state:
#
#   happy path:  old (vN)  --pg_upgrade-->  new shut down cleanly, "in
#                production" state, control checkpoint past the upgrade window
#                --first start-->  auto-serves, not in recovery, data preserved,
#                target major version.
#
#   crash path:  old (vN)  --pg_upgrade with COMPLETE suppressed-->  a window
#                with START but no COMPLETE on disk  --first start-->  FATAL
#                (never serves a half-built catalog); the old cluster stays
#                intact and startable, and the dead-end new cluster is discarded
#                with rm -rf (there is no revert interface).
#
# Cross-version: when $ENV{oldinstall} is set the old cluster is built with an
# older major's binaries (checksums are pre-18 so pass -k there); otherwise the
# test runs same-version, exercising the state machine without a real gap.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ASSUMPTIONS AND INVARIANTS --wal-upgrade relies on (why this works):
#
#  1. The window is self-contained and atomic.  pg_upgrade writes the whole
#     upgrade as a WAL "window": an end-of-upgrade checkpoint (CN), then
#     XLOG_UPGRADE_START, the system-relation/SLRU/rawfile/dirtree images, and
#     XLOG_UPGRADE_COMPLETE.  Recovery anchors at CN and either reaches COMPLETE
#     (fully upgraded) or it did not -- there is no half-upgraded steady state.
#
#  2. COMPLETE is the atomicity boundary.  A window with START but no COMPLETE
#     (crash mid-upgrade) must NEVER be served: the catalog is half-built and
#     the cluster auto-serves read-write at end of recovery, so serving it would
#     expose a corrupt catalog.  First startup FATALs in that case.  The durable
#     pg_control upgrade_finalized flag (paired with a control checkpoint past CN)
#     distinguishes a finished upgrade from a crashed partial one even if a torn
#     final WAL page hides the COMPLETE record.
#
#  3. The old cluster stays intact on the copy-family transfer modes.  With
#     copy/clone/copy_file_range the old datadir's files are only read, so a
#     failed or crashed upgrade can always fall back to starting the old cluster
#     (the crash path below asserts this).  (link/swap deliberately give that up,
#     as in stock pg_upgrade.)
#
#  4. Counters ride in the CN checkpoint.  The XID/OID/multixact counters are
#     transplanted into pg_control before CN rather than WAL-logged separately,
#     so the CN checkpoint record reproduces them on replay.
