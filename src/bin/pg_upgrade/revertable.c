 *	  --wal-upgrade-signal-handoff  -d old   trigger streaming standbys to stand down
 *
 *	(A fresh standby needs no prepare step: with primary_conninfo set it
 *	derives the upgrade window anchor (CN) locally from its retained old datadir
 *	and streams the window -- see ArmFromLocalDerivationIfConfigured in
 *	pgupgrade_wal.c.)

 * --wal-upgrade-signal-handoff: connect to the live old primary and write the
 * streaming-handoff trigger into its (old-format) WAL.  It emits a WAL record
 * that propagates to streaming standbys through the normal replication path,
 * rather than contacting each standby.  On replaying it, a standby shuts down
 * cleanly, ready for the new-version binary swap / re-provision.  Run this
 * before stopping the old
 * primary and running pg_upgrade.
 *
 * Unlike --wal-upgrade itself (which acts on stopped clusters), this one
 * requires the old primary to be RUNNING.  The target major version passed to
 * the trigger is this pg_upgrade binary's own major (the new version the
 * standby will converge to).
