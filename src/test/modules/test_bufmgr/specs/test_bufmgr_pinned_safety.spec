# Test - pinned-buffer safety under eviction pressure.
#
# Property (must hold for ANY correct buffer manager): a pinned buffer is never
# selected as an eviction victim. While one backend holds a pin on a page,
# another backend can drive allocation pressure far exceeding the whole shared
# buffer pool, and the pinned page must remain resident and its contents valid.
#
# The pin is held across statements using an existing PostgreSQL facility,
# a suspended cursor. A plain transaction does not keep heap-page pins between
# statements (each scan drops its pins when it finishes), but a cursor that has
# fetched into its scan keeps the current page pinned until it advances or
# closes.
#
# A control "probe" block, resident but UNPINNED, guards against a vacuous
# pass: the flood must actually exceed the pool, which we prove by asserting the
# probe block is evicted while the pinned block survives. If the flood were too
# small, the probe would remain resident and the test would fail loudly instead
# of passing for the wrong reason.
