 *	eqfuncoids: OIDs of equality comparison functions to use
 *	hashfunctions: FmgrInfos of datatype-specific hashing functions to use

 *	nelements: initial estimate of hashtable size
 *	additionalsize: size of data that may be stored along with the hash entry
 *	metacxt: memory context for long-lived data and the simplehash table
 *	tuplescxt: memory context in which to store the hashed tuples themselves
 *	tempcxt: short-lived context for evaluation hash and comparison functions
 *	use_variable_hash_iv: if true, adjust hash IV per-parallel-worker
 *
 * The hashfunctions array may be made with execTuplesHashPrepare().  Note they
 * are not cross-type functions, but expect to see the table datatype(s)
 * on both sides.
 *
 * Note that the keyColIdx, hashfunctions, and collations arrays must be
 * allocated in storage that will live as long as the hashtable does.
 *
 * The metacxt and tuplescxt are separate because it's usually desirable for
 * tuplescxt to be a BumpContext to avoid memory wastage, while metacxt must
 * support pfree in case the simplehash table needs to be enlarged.  (We could
 * simplify the API of TupleHashTables by managing the tuplescxt internally.
 * But that would be disadvantageous to nodeAgg.c and nodeSubplan.c, which use
 * a single tuplescxt for multiple TupleHashTables that are reset together.)
 *
 * LookupTupleHashEntry, FindTupleHashEntry, and related functions may leak
 * memory in the tempcxt.  It is caller's responsibility to reset that context
 * reasonably often, typically once per tuple.  (We do it that way, rather
 * than managing an extra context within the hashtable, because in many cases
 * the caller can specify a tempcxt that it needs to reset per-tuple anyway.)
 *
 * We don't currently provide DestroyTupleHashTable functionality; the hash
 * table will be cleaned up at destruction of the metacxt.  (Some callers
 * bother to delete the tuplescxt explicitly, though it'd be sufficient to
 * ensure it's a child of the metacxt.)  There's not much point in working
 * harder than this so long as the expression-evaluation infrastructure
 * behaves similarly.
