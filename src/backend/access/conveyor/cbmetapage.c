 * cbmetapage.c
 *	  APIs for accessing conveyor belt metapages.
 *
 * The goal of this file is to provide a set of functions that can be
 * used to perform all necessary access to or modification of a conveyor
 * belt metapage. The functions in this file should be the only backend
 * code that knows about the actual organization of CBMetapageData,
 * but they shouldn't know about the internals of other types of pages
 * (like index segment or freespace map pages) nor should they know
 * about buffers or locking.
 *
 * Much - but not all - of the work done here is sanity checking. We
 * do this partly to catch bugs, and partly as a defense against the
 * possibility that the metapage is corrupted on disk. Because of the
 * latter possibility, most of these checks use an elog(ERROR) rather
 * than just Assert.
